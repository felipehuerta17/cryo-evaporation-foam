This scenario assumes the maximum liquid phase overall heat transfer coefficient,

U_max = Q/A_L

Considering that the experimental heat ingress only measures liquid heat ingress and the vapour heat ingress is removed by advection.
If we get a worse fit it will not be a big deal, as the argument will be more solid
