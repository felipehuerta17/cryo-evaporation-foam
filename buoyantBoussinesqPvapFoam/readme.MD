# buoyantBoussinesqPvapFoam

Modified version of buoyantBoussinesqPimpleFoam
to simulate the non-isobaric evaporation of a pure
cryogenic liquid.

- 2D N-S Equations are solved in the liquid
- Simplified models are solved in the vapour phase,
such as Equilibrium, non-equilibrium convection,
non-equilibrium 1-D with analytical solutions.

Developed for OpenFOAM -v2006 and Linux 18.14 LTS.
